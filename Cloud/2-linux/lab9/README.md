## Starting a Process:
> When you start a process (run a command), two ways of do it:
1. Foreground Processes
2. Background Processes

### _Foreground Processes_:
> By default, every process that you start runs in the foreground. It gets its input from the keyboard and sends its output to the screen. <br/>
> While a program is running in the foreground and is time-consuming, no other commands can be run (start any other processes) because the prompt would not be available until the program finishes processing and comes out.
