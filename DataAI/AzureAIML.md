## AI Search 

> Built-in indexers are available for `Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, and Microsoft SQL Server hosted in Azure Virtual Machines`. Use Azure `Data Factory`, with more than 80 connectors, or `Azure Logic Apps` to connect to your data source. Alternatively, push data into an Azure AI Search index, which has no restrictions on data source type.
